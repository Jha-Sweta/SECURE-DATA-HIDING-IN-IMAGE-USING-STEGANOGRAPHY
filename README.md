# SECURE-DATA-HIDING-IN-IMAGE-USING-STEGANOGRAPHY

# Image Steganography using Python

## Project Overview
This project implements **Image Steganography** using Python and OpenCV, allowing users to hide secret messages within images. The application provides a user-friendly **GUI** using the **Tkinter** library, enabling both encoding and decoding of hidden messages. The message is securely hidden, and only users with the correct password can retrieve it.

## Features
- **Hide Secret Messages**: Encode confidential messages inside an image.
- **Password Protection**: Messages can only be decoded with the correct password.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Easy-to-use interface with separate encoding and decoding windows.
- **Supports Common Image Formats**: Works with PNG, JPG, and JPEG image files.

## Requirements
Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- Python (>=3.x)
- OpenCV (`cv2` package)
- Tkinter (default with Python)

To install OpenCV, run: pip install opencv-python


## How to Run the Project
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Run the script: python Project.py


## Usage Instructions
1. **Encoding Process:**
   - Enter a secret message and password.
   - Select an image to hide the message.
   - An encoded image will be saved and opened automatically.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - Open the decoding window.
   - Enter the correct password.
   - Select the encoded image to reveal the hidden message.

## End Users
- Individuals seeking **data privacy** for sensitive messages.
- **Cybersecurity enthusiasts** exploring steganography techniques.
- **Educational purposes** for learning data encoding in images.

## Future Scope
- Enhance encryption by integrating advanced **cryptographic algorithms**.
- Support for **audio and video** steganography.
- Implement a **multi-level security** system with layered password protection.
- Improve efficiency for **large image** processing.

## Conclusion
This project provides a simple yet effective method to hide messages within images using **image steganography**. It offers a secure environment where only users with the correct password can decode and retrieve hidden information.
